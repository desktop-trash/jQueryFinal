        <h3>OUTSKIRTS</h3>
        <p>
            The game beings with James inside of a rest stop bathroom. In your first play through, nothing will be here, 
            so just exit out. Immediately after gaining control of James, leave the restroom and get the Silent Hill Map 
            out of your car. The car door is open and the map is on the drivers side seat, examine the seat to collect it. 
            This map will be very useful while navigating Silent Hill. Immediately after gaining control of James, leave 
            the restroom and get the Silent Hill Map out of your car. The car door is open and the map is on the drivers 
            side seat, examine the seat to collect it. This map will be very useful while navigating Silent Hill. <br><br>Once you 
            enter the Graveyard, a cut scene will play out. James will be greeted by a mysterious woman named Angela. She 
            will attempt to warn him away from the city, but James is dead set on going into the town. After the scene, 
            leave through the West gate. Again you will be faced with a long walk down a singular path leading into the town. 
            Follow it until you reach the Flower Shop in Silent Hill

            <h3>STREETS</h3>
            <p>
                After following Wiltse Rd you will emerge onto Sanders St, directly infront of the Flower Shop. Grab a First-Aid Kit 
                on the table to the left of the shop and head North to activate a short cut scene. Looks like a Monster is nearby. 
                Follow the blood trails North on Lindsey Street and East on Vachss Road. When you head down Vachss Road, you'll find 
                a small gated area to the right. Enter through the gate and you'll find two Health Drinks and a Save Square on a table. 
                One Health Drink is near the leg of the table, and one health drink is in the left bottom corner. <br><br>Continue down the road 
                until you come to a blocked off tunnel. Investigate the opening to enter and start a short cut scene. During the scene 
                you'll find a Radio, a Wooden Plank with nails on one end, and a Straight Jacket Monster. Once the scene ends, use the 
                plank to beat down the monster until it's dead. The radio will emit static if a monster is nearby. Now you can roam 
                Silent Hill, pick up items, and fight some monsters; or just continue on the correct path.

                The next thing you need to do is get a certain key. This key is located at the end of Martin Street. If you need to get 
                there from the first monster fight, head West on Vachss Road, South on Lindsey STreet, West on Katz Street, and North 
                on Martin Street. At the end of the street is a dead, bloody body. Investigate it to find the Apartment Gate Key. 
                Examine the key to see it belongs to the Wood Side Apartments, just two blocks to the West. Head there now if you like, 
                or search around Silent Hill a bit more for items. You can find Handgun Bullets and a First Aid Kit in front of 
                Lucky Jade Restaurant on the way to the Apartments. There will also be a few Straight Jacket Monsters skulking about. 
                Remember, Silent Hill is a survival horror. You don't have to fight the monsters! Run away or stand and fight, it's 
                your choice.<br><br>
                Two areas you can enter before going to the Woodside Apartments are the Motor Home on Saul Street and Neely's Bar on 
                the corner of Neely and Sanders. The Motor Home will have nothing but a Save Square and a note that says "Meet me at 
                Neely's Bar." If you met the requirements to unlock the Hyper Spray you can go to the Motor Home at the South Western 
                corner of the map and pick it up. It will be on Saul Street. Neely's Bar is pretty empty. There's a map with a few things 
                crossed off on the counter, and a note written in red on the window. When you're done, reach and enter the Wood Side Apartments.

            <h3>APARTMENTS</h3>
            <p>
                Use the Apartment Gate Key to open up the gate of the Wood Side Apartments. There are two doors, one in front of you and 
                one to the right. Enter the door straight ahead. Inside is a Map of the Apt Bldg, a Health Drink and a Save Square. 
                Head up the stairs and enter the Second Floor. Immediately to your right is a laundry room -- there won't be a door into 
                the room. If you look into the trash chute, you will notice a bag of trash that is stuck. You can't do anything right now, 
                but the map will be marked for later. There may be a Straight Jacket or two in the halls. Always be prepared to fight or run! 
                <br><br>The first apartment you should enter is 205. It will contain a most invaluable item: the Flashlight. After picking it up a 
                Mannequin monster will attack you. Kill it or just run away. 210 has a Straight Jacket and Mannequin inside, so be prepared 
                for a fight. Also inside is a box of Handgun Bullets in the living area on the coffee table, and in the northern room on a 
                nightstand. 208 has a Clock Puzzle inside, but you can't solve it just yet. There's nothing else to do on Floor two for now, 
                so on to floor 3. Head up to the third floor and you'll find a gate directly to the right. On the other side of the gate is 
                a key on the floor. Investigate the gate and the game will ask if you want to pick it up. Say yes to activate a short cut 
                scene. Inside 301, you can find a Handgun in a red shopping cart. Grab it, but remember to conserve your ammo throughout the 
                game. Save it for the boss battles. Return to the second floor after taking the handgun and go to 208.

                Apartment 208 is a bit different from last time you were here. There will be a dead body next to the TV. You can investigate 
                it to play a short cut scene. On the book shelf to the left of the dead body is the Key to Room 202. Guess where we're headed next. 
                Enter Apartment 202 and pick up the Health Drink in the kitchen. Go into the bedroom to find a hole in the wall. Investigate the 
                hole to find the Clock Key. Now that you have the Clock Key, you can solve the puzzle in Apartment 208's bedroom. There is writing 
                on the side of the clock that says, "The scars from the past shall remove the nail that stops Time." After reading it, it will 
                ask if you want to push the clock. The clock's face is stopped at different times. The face plate will be locked, preventing you 
                from moving the needles. <br><br>After obtaining the Clock Key from room 202, you must find the proper time to display on the clock so 
                that it will move and allow you passage into the next area of the apartment building. Look at the wall on the opposite side of 
                the room for a hint at the correct time. Sketched into the wall are three arrows, similar to hands on a clock, and three names: 
                Henry, Mildred, and Scott. These names are all code for Hours, Minutes, and Seconds. Simply convert the arrows into a time. 
                Examine the clock, then use the key from your inventory menu. You'll open the faceplate, allowing you to change the time. 
                Change the time to 9:10:15 and you'll hear a click. Close the faceplate and read the side of the clock to push it away. Behind 
                the clock is a hole to the next Apartment.

                Grab the Health Drink in the kitchen and save your game at the Save Square on the small table nearby. When you're done, 
                exit out the front door and head up the stairwell to the third floor. On the way up, you'll find a box or two of Handgun Bullets. 
                When you're done, exit out the front door and head up the stairwell to the third floor. On the way up, you'll find a box or two 
                of Handgun Bullets. Enter Apartment 307 to start a cut scene. When it finishes, look back in the closet for the Courtyard Key. 
                Walk back out to the hall and head towards the Laundry Room. <br><br>Now that you're on this side of the gate, you can pick up the 
                Fire Escape Key off the floor. Check inside the Laundry Room for a box of Handgun Bullets. Apartment 303 contains a First-Aid Kit 
                in the living room, a box of Handgun Bullets in one of the bedrooms on a bed, and a Health Drink in the kitchen. When you're done, 
                head to the East end of the hall and go through the door at the end. Take the stairs down to the first floor. Go to the back door 
                and grab the pack of Canned Juice. Exit out the front door and enter the other front door to the West. Before going up to the second floor, 
                head to the back door on the first floor and use the Courtyard Key. Walk into the Courtyard to find the community pool. 
                Inside the pool is a baby carriage and three Straight Jackets. Jump into the pool and investigate the carriage to find the Coin-Snake.
